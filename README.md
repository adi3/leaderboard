# [LEADERBOARD] (http://leaderboard.pagodabox.com)

Web app for tracking ranks of this year's CouchSurfing video contest entries.
Built with CodeIgniter, this app uses YouTube API to retrieve data for all entries displayed on the official contest page (180++ 
as of 10/31/2012), and gives users the option to rank them according to likes, views, duration (length) and title. A Show-Repeated 
feature keeps track of all entries that are displayed more than once, perhaps erroneously, on the contest page.
Details of the competition at http://couchsurfing.org/contest.

**Note:** Since the app has to retrieve updated info from YouTube for all entries, the page could take some time to load (~15 sec).

## Features

* One-click update of rankings for all contest entries
* Sort entries by likes, views, duration and title
